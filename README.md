# FetchSummarizeSend MCP Agent for Personalized News Digests

This project implements a fully custom, low-level MCP (Model Context Protocol) Agent that fetches the latest news, summarizes it, identifies interested users from a database, and emails them a digest — all without relying on any SDKs or external agent frameworks.

It serves as a reference implementation of end-to-end tool orchestration using Claude's tool-calling API with a modular Express.js backend.

## 🔧 Architecture Overview

The system follows a modular design with four key tool routes:

- `/fetch-news` – Fetches news articles via NewsAPI based on a topic
- `/summarize-news` – Summarizes fetched articles using the Claude API
- `/fetch-users` – Retrieves user emails from Supabase based on their interests
- `/send-email` – Sends the digest to users using NodeMailer and Gmail SMTP

An MCP-compatible agent interacts with these tools by generating tool calls, parsing responses, and chaining them recursively.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

### 🧠 Claude API (Anthropic)
- Tool Use and Result Blocks: Implements structured tool-calling using Claude 3's messages API
- Recursive conversation loop: Each tool call result is added back into the prompt context to drive the next reasoning step

### 🛠️ Custom MCP Agent Runtime (no SDKs!)
- Built from scratch with no reliance on SDKs or orchestration frameworks
- Recursive tool execution loop in serverLlmConversation.js
- Tool schemas declared in JSON Schema format (toolSchemas.js)

### 🌐 External API Integration
- NewsAPI (newsapi.js) – REST call with query customization
  - Constructs parameterized URL requests
  - Maps and simplifies response payload

### 🧾 Text Summarization via Claude
- summarizeNews.js dynamically builds prompt based on style and length
- Uses Claude to generate editorial-style digests in plain text

### 🧑‍💻 Supabase Integration
- Pulls user emails by interest tag using @supabase/supabase-js
- Uses Postgres-compatible ilike search for flexible matching

### 📧 Email Delivery
- Uses nodemailer with Gmail's SMTP interface
- Dynamic email subject + digest body
- Sends to all matched users in a single batch

### 🧵 Tool Routing and Modularity
Tools exposed as modular Express routers under:
- /services/newsapi.js
- /services/summarizeNews.js
- /services/fetchUsers.js
- /services/sendEmail.js

Registered in serverOps.js, exposing tool routes under root

### 🧪 Agent Entry Point
- server.js initializes the server and launches the conversation loop
- addUserMessage() sets the agent's objective
- runConversation() kicks off recursive tool usage

### 🧰 Full Toolchain Recap

| Capability | Technology |
|------------|------------|
| Agent Orchestration | Claude 3 API (manual MCP impl) |
| News Fetching | NewsAPI + Axios |
| Summarization | Claude 3 (prompt-based) |
| DB Retrieval | Supabase + JS Client |
| Email Sending | Nodemailer + Gmail SMTP |
| HTTP Server & Routing | Express.js |
| Environment Config | dotenv |
| API Logging | Console instrumentation |

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

This repo showcases how to:
- Build an MCP-compatible agent entirely from scratch
- Expose standalone REST tools that plug cleanly into LLM-driven workflows
- Chain complex tool outputs (news -> summary -> audience -> email)
- Use LLMs for high-reasoning tasks like intent parsing, input inference, and content generation
- Operate without dependency lock-in — no SDKs, no serverless wrappers, no hidden state

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a .env file (see below)
3. Run `node server.js`

### Example .env
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key

## 🧑‍🔬 Created By

This project is part of a hands-on exploration of advanced AI agent workflows using Claude and custom MCP infrastructure. It demonstrates how real-world, multi-step automation can be built entirely from primitives.

Feel free to fork, adapt, or expand. Contributions welcome!

## 🤔 Example of Reasoning Steps

Below is a sample of the logs from running the agent, which demonstrates how it breaks down complex tasks into logical steps and executes them sequentially:
